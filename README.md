# Hi, I'm Há»“ng ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a Digital Marketing executive with over 2 years of experience in **content creation, campaign execution, customer insights, SEO Optimization, and Meta & Google Ads**.  
Along the way, I discovered my passion for **data and analytics**, and started building strong technical skills in **SQL, Python, Pandas, Power BI, and Tableau**.  

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities in **Marketing & Data Analysis**, where I can combine my business background with data-driven problem solving.  

ðŸ”Ž My curiosity drives me to continually search for answers, uncover patterns, and transform data into meaningful stories that support informed decisions.  

Outside of work, I enjoy learning new things, hanging out, and sharing my knowledge.
