# WELCOME. Hi, I'm Hong ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a Digital Marketing executive with over 2 years of experience in **content creation, campaign execution, customer insights, SEO Optimization, and Meta & Google Ads**.  
Along the way, I discovered my passion for **data and analytics**, and started building strong technical skills in **SQL, Python, Pandas, Power BI, and Tableau**.  

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities in **Marketing & Data Analysis**, where I can combine my business background with data-driven problem solving.  

ðŸ”Ž My curiosity drives me to continually search for answers, uncover patterns, and transform data into meaningful stories that support informed decisions.  

Outside of work, I enjoy learning new things, hanging out, and sharing my knowledge.  

# PORTFOLIO DATA SCIENCE - PROJECT 
## I/ Sementation Project:

Customer segmentation is the best method to understand customer insight, which is the process of dividing customers into smaller groups based on their attributes. This generates insight clearer and more actionable when analyzing the entire population at once. 

In customer segmentation analytics, this can be done in various ways, such as Percentile Scoring (IQR), Cohort, RFM, K-Means Models, and so on.

- Online Retail Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
