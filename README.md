# WELCOME. Hi, I'm Hong ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a Digital Marketing executive with over 2 years of experience in **content creation, campaign execution, customer insights, SEO Optimization, and Meta & Google Ads**. Along the way, I discovered my passion for **data and analytics**, and started building strong technical skills in **SQL, Python, Pandas, Power BI, and Tableau**.  

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities in **Marketing & Data Analysis**, where I can combine my business background with data-driven problem solving.  

ðŸ”Ž My curiosity drives me to continually search for answers, uncover patterns, and transform data into meaningful stories that support informed decisions.  

Outside of work, I enjoy learning new things, hanging out, and sharing my knowledge.  

# PORTFOLIO DATA SCIENCE - PROJECT 
## I/ Sementation Project:

Customer segmentation is the best method to understand customer insight, which is the process of dividing customers into smaller groups based on their attributes. This generates insight clearer and more actionable when analyzing the entire population at once. 

In customer segmentation analytics, this can be done in various ways, such as Percentile Scoring (IQR), Cohort, RFM, K-Means Models, and so on.  

**What I did in the project:**
- Cleaned and pre-processed the Online Retail Dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights
- Applied percentile analysis to rank customers by value contribution
- Built cohort tables to track retention rate, churn rate and CLV
- Conducted RFM analysis to classify customers into actionable groups (e.g., loyal, at-risk, new)
- Applied K-Means clustering to uncover hidden customer segments beyond rule-based methods

**ðŸ›  Dataset**
- Online Retail Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

- Transactional data including Invoice No., Product, Quantity, Invoice Date, Unit Price, and Customer ID.

**ðŸ”§ Methods & Applications**
### 1. Percentile Scoring
- The Percentile method is a simple yet powerful way to segment customers based on their attributes. In this project, I applied Excel, SQL (BigQuery), and Python to calculate and assign percentile scores to customers.
- By ranking customers into groups such as the top 10% or top 25%, I was able to identify high-value customers and compare them with lower-value segments.

### 2. Cohort Analysis
- The Cohort method groups customers by their acquisition time and tracks how their behavior evolves over time. In this project, I used SQL and Python to build cohorts based on the month of first purchase, then calculated retention rates across subsequent months to analyze customer loyalty and churn patterns.

### 3. RFM Analysis
- I calculated RFM 3 features: 
  - [Recency (R)]: How recently a customer purchased
  - [Frequency (F)]: How often they purchased
  - [Monetary (M)]: How much they spent

### 4. KMeans Clustering
- To uncover hidden customer segments beyond rule-based methods, I combined RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and applied the K-Means clustering algorithm. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, ensuring meaningful and well-separated customer groups for deeper business insights.

## II/ Bike Store Sale Analysis Project
### 1. Project Overview
- This project analyzes 3 years of bike store sales data (2014â€“2016) to uncover the reasons behind a sudden sales decline in 2016. In addition, I performed customer segmentation to identify high-potential customer groups and provide recommendations for more targeted marketing and business strategies.

### 2. Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ data extraction, cleaning, preprocessing, EDA
- Tableau & Power BI â€“ building interactive dashboards and visualizations
- Machine Learning â€“ Linear Regression model for predictive analysis

### 3. Project Workflow
#### a. Date Preparation
- Extracted, cleaned, and preprocessed sales data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and Excel
- Ensured data accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis

#### b. Overview Data & Time-series Analysis
- Analyzed sales trends across 2014â€“2016
- Identified seasonal patterns and pinpointed where and when sales dropped in 2016

#### c. Customer Analysis & Segmentation
- Applied Rule-based Clustering (RFM segmentation) to categorize customers into groups such as Loyal, At-Risk, and New
- Conducted K-Means Clustering to uncover hidden behavioral patterns
- Performed Cohort Analysis to evaluate customer retention over time

#### d. Predictive Modeling
- Built a Linear Regression model to identify factors influencing sales performance and quantify their impact

#### e. Market Basket Analysis
- Applied association rule mining to detect frequently bought-together products
- Suggested bundling and cross-selling opportunities to increase revenue

#### f. Visualization & Dashboarding
- Designed interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI and presentations by using Canva

### 4. Key Outcomes
- Identified root causes of sales decline in 2016, including seasonality shifts and changing customer behavior
- Segmented customers into actionable groups for targeted marketing and retention strategies
- Discovered cross-selling opportunities through Market Basket Analysis
- Gained practical, end-to-end experience in business analytics, segmentation, and visualization
